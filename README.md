## TDD Practice

A little nodejs server build using

- TDD
- Dependencies injection pattern

Building the app with unitaries tests and integration tests

### Starting

First install dependencies with `yarn`, then you can run `yarn test` or start the server

```bash
$ yarn
$ yarn test
$ yarn start
```

This example only have one endpoint `POST`, and use _[jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/)_ to mock some data

### Purposes

- Educative
